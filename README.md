# Personalized-Context-Aware-Meal-Planner

This is an Android application to simplify meal planning by providing personalized recommendations. This app utilizes artificial intelligence and data analytics to customize meal suggestions based on individual health profiles, dietary preferences, and real-time health indicators such as heart rate. As part of Project 5, the application analyzes various metrics, including the user's required calorie intake, location, and weather conditions. It also takes into account critical factors like local and seasonal food availability, as well as any dietary preferences or restrictions. Using this comprehensive analysis and the user's profile, the app generates a personalized daily meal plan and identifies nearby grocery stores where users can purchase the necessary food ingredients.


# Project Structure:
The project consists of 2 applications - UI and Server. UI is the Android application developed in react native and Server is a Python application to handle API calls from UI.
